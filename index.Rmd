Earth teems with biodiversity: plants, animals, and countless microorganisms. How does this biodiversity assemble into communities and how does it affect ecosystem functioning? My research is driven by a curiosity
about 1) the biological patterns and processes that shape ecological communities and their functions, and 2)
the relationship of communities and their drivers to global changes. Community assemblages can
be explained by abiotic and biotic conditions in the environment, but these assemblages and conditions differ in space and time. The endeavor to understand this complexity is what makes studying ecology so exciting for me.

Currently, I am a postdoc in the [Institute for Ecology and Evolution](https://ie2.uoregon.edu/) at the University of Oregon. I am investigating how varying precipitation in California rangelands affects plant communities and production, and how compost addition to these rangelands relates to soil C sequestration, drought mitigation, and plant diversity.

I graduated from [Colorado State University](https://ecology.colostate.edu/) with a PhD in ecology in 2018 and an MSc in ecology in 2013, where I focused on unraveling the biotic and abiotic drivers of soil
biodiversity and its community structure, trophic interactions, and contributions to ecosystem
functions. I have studied in a range of ecosystems from grassland to urban to cold desert, including: Konza Tallgrass Prairie (KS), Central Park (NY), Rocky Mountain National Park (CO), and the McMurdo Dry Valleys (Antarctica).
