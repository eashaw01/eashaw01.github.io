## Welcome!  
I am a community ecologist researching the role of soil and plant biodiversity in ecosystem functions and soil health. My goal is to improve our understanding of how ecosystems respond to management under global changes, and the role that ecological communities play in regulating ecosystem resilience. I work across fields to combine field surveys, field and laboratory experiments, and long-term data synthesis with land manager participation and feedback to this end. My work spans a variety of systems, including working rangelands, serpentine grasslands, subalpine forests, temperate grasslands, and Antarctic cold deserts. 

I love science! Learning and sharing the scientific knowledge that will help us to better understand our world, its biodiversity and ecosystem functions, and our ability to manage and protect it is at the core of my long-term career goals. Get in touch and let's talk science!
