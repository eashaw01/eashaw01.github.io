## Welcome!  
I am a community ecologist researching the role of soil and plant biodiversity in ecosystem functions and soil health. My goal is to improve our understanding of how ecosystems respond to management under global changes, and the role that ecological communities play in regulating ecosystem resilience. I work across fields to combine field surveys, field and laboratory experiments, and long-term data synthesis with land manager participation and feedback to this end. My work spans a variety of systems, including working rangelands, serpentine grasslands, subalpine forests, temperate grasslands, and Antarctic cold deserts.
