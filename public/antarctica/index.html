  <h1 id="title"> Antarctic Soil Ecosystems</h1>
  <p><p>Antarctic ecosystems are an incredible model system for studying soil communities. In the absence of plants and other interacting factors, the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica (MDV) provide a unique opportunity to study complete soil communities where all invertebrate taxa can be identified. These systems have extremely low soil organic C and for decades a two-level food web (microbes and their grazers) was accepted. Using a stable isotope approach to distinguish trophic levels, my research shows that despite extremely low C availability, the MDV soils support at least three trophic levels, including an omnivore-predator (Shaw et al. 2018).</p>
<p>The MDV soil trophic structures shift under environmental change, where increased soil salinity (such as what occurs when permafrost melt relocates solutes) releases bacteria from top-down pressure as bacteria grazing nematodes decline (Shaw and Wall 2019). By tracking C sources in the soil food web, I found that these changes have landscape-level implications for community and ecosystem responses to global change. Glacier and permafrost melt cause soil invertebrates to shift from very old legacy C to new C sources that become available as cyanobacteria, algae, and mosses grow in newly wet habitat. This new C promotes spread of taxa that were previously limited lake and stream margins, increasing diversity and changing communities of previously dry soils (Shaw et al. in prep).</p>
